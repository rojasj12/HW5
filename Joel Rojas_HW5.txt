Lab 4:
In lab 4 we seek to understand the determinants of wages using the ACS 2017 dataset. The lab focusses on factors such as age, gender, race and education level influenced an individual’s wages.

Steps:
1.	After Loading the data, we created a subset of the data for individuals aged 25-55 the so called ‘prime age”. These individuals also are in the labor force, work year-round and are full-time employees.
2.	Ran a summary to identify any potential data issues.
3.	Used a linear regression model where wage os the dependent variable and the factors described previously serve as the independent variables.
4.	Used AER to test the significance and relationship of the variables in the model.
5.	Visualized the data using a scatter plot.
Some Results:
•	Age:
o	Statistically significant (p<0/01)
o	For every 1 year increase an age a person wage is expected to increase by $1,326.70
•	Female:
o	Statistically significant (p<0/01)
o	Females can expect to earn $24,939.46 less than males.
•	African Americans:
o	Statistically significant (p<0/01)
o	African Americans can expect to earn $11,934.25 less than non- African Americans.
•	Hispanic:
o	Statistically significant (p<0/01)
o	Hispanics can expect to earn $4,224.82 less than non-Hispanics.
•	Edu College:
o	Statistically significant (p<0/01)
Individuals with college degrees can expect to earn $57,155.71 more than those without college degrees. 
•	Edu Advanced Degree:
o	Statistically significant (p<0/01)
o	Individuals with advanced degrees can expect to earn $82,766.43 more than those without advanced degrees. 

  
 

My own Factors and Test:
1. veteran Variable:
Result: -5,901.965 with a standard error of 2,145.208 (indicated by *** suggests p < 0.01
P-value: p < 0.01
Confidence Interval (95%): [-10,146.136, -1,657.794]
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Veterans have less wage than non-veterans.
Explanation: Veterans can expect to make $5,901.97 less than non veterans. We do not reject the null hypothesis.

2. BUILTYR2 Variable:
Result: 1,267.554 with a standard error of 97.588.
P-value: < 0.01
Confidence Interval (95%): [1,076.647, 1,458.461]
Null Hypothesis (H₀): The year the house was built has no effect on wages.
Explanation: For each increase (most recent) that the house was built we can expect an individual to see an increase on $1,267.56 in wages. Given the standard error and p value, we reject the null hypothesis. 

3. unmarried Variable:
Result: -10,741.770 with a standard error of 843.755.
P-value: < 0.01
Confidence Interval (95%): [-12,400.887, -9,082.653]
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Being unmarried has no effect on wages.
Explanation: Unmarried individuals make $10,741.77 less than married individuals, given the standard error and p value, we reject the null hypothesis.
